# 🛡️ SOC Labs

Hands-on labs and exercises focused on **Security Operations (SOC)**, **detection engineering**, and **incident response**.  
This repo is a working log of practical blue-team work: detections, investigations, and automation.

---

## 📂 Repository Layout

- **notes/** – technical observations, cheat sheets, and deep dives  
- **incidents/** – simulated incident reports & timelines (SOC-style)  
- **queries/** – detection logic for SIEMs (Splunk SPL, KQL, Wazuh)  
- **scripts/** – automation helpers (Python/Bash) used in labs  

---

## 🔍 Example Scenarios

- Detecting brute-force attempts in authentication logs  
- Investigating suspicious PowerShell / process creation  
- Writing SIEM queries to hunt for beaconing or exfil patterns  
- Automating log parsing & enrichment with Python  

---

## 🧩 Purpose

- Build a personal SOC lab trail that demonstrates practical skill  
- Develop detection logic for common attack techniques  
- Practice real-world incident handling & documentation  
- Use Python to speed up routine detection/IR tasks
