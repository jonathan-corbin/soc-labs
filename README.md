# Security Operations Labs

A collection of hands-on labs and exercises in security operations, detection, and incident response.  
This repository highlights practical skills through notes, incident simulations, SIEM queries, and automation scripts.

## 📂 Layout
- `notes/` — technical observations and write-ups from lab work  
- `incidents/` — simulated incident reports and timelines  
- `queries/` — detection logic and SIEM searches (Splunk, Wazuh, KQL, etc.)  
- `scripts/` — automation helpers (Python/Bash)  
- `k8s-labs/` — container security and hardening experiments  

## 🛠️ Examples of Work
- Investigating authentication logs for brute force activity  
- Writing detection queries to flag suspicious patterns  
- Simulating phishing incidents and documenting response steps  
- Automating log parsing and enrichment with Python  
- Testing segmentation and access controls in containerized environments
